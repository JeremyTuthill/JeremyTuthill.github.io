# JeremyTuthill.github.io
This is my personal website, which can be accessed at the URL 'JeremyTuthill.github.io'.

The only tools I am using for this project are HTML and CSS. Though I am experienced with JavaScript, I think this website is simple enough that I don't need to make it dynamic.

The CSS file I used for this website is from 'www.getskeleton.com'. They have a very good lightweight style sheet that can make a simple website look very clean.
